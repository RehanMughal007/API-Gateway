Description
API Gateway is a robust, high-performance solution that acts as the single entry point for all your backend services and microservices. It simplifies API management by handling crucial tasks like request routing, composition, authentication, and rate limiting in one centralized place. By decoupling your clients from your services, API Gateway allows you to evolve your backend architecture without impacting your end-users.
Our platform provides comprehensive security features, including OAuth 2.0, API key validation, and IP whitelisting, to protect your services from malicious attacks and misuse. The real-time analytics dashboard offers deep visibility into API traffic, latency, and error rates, enabling you to monitor performance and troubleshoot issues proactively. Whether you are building microservices, exposing data to partners, or powering a mobile application, API Gateway provides the control and reliability you need to scale your API strategy.
